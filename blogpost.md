# Measuring the effect of Rust dependencies on your toolchain horizen

During a recent project to get the [Rust client] for the [TigerBeetle database]
ready for production,
I went through a typical process of establishing the minimum supported version
of the Rust toolchain the crate could support.

It usually goes something like this:

1. todo
2. todo harder

What I found was in hindsight not surprising,
but at the time was kinda revelatory,
even though I have gone through the process numerous times.

I eventually settled on the minimum supported version
being [Rust 1.63].

todo
