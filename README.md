# Toolchain Horizons

Exploring dependency-toolchain compatibility.

I recently observed in Rust that having just one dependency
made it much harder to make my crate compatible with older toolchains.

I did an experiment and a presentation and a blog about it.

The slides are at [brson.github.io/toolchain-horizons](https://brson.github.io/toolchain-horizons).
